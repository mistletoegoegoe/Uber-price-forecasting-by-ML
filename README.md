# Uber-price-forecasting-by-ML
The project used machine learning KNN and Random forest to forecast Uber price based on contributing variables.
## I. Introduction
Ride share services have become increasingly popular in the past decade. Uber and Lyft are leading companies in this field. To keep up with demand and increase profitability, these companies use dynamic pricing to encourage more drivers to pick up requests and keep up with demand. The pricing is greatly affected by the demand and supply of rides at a given time, dates or weather condition. 

The uber company try to analyze the prices of these ride-sharing apps and try to figure out what factors are driving the demand and how to use them as input to forecast the price of each ride. 

This project implemented 2 machine learning techniques to analyse and make prediction to the ride based on contributing variables. 

**Analysing tool: Rapid Miner software.**
